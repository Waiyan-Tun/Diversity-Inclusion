# Diversity & Inclusion Dashboard

## Data Analysis & Visualization Project

### Introduction

This Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) dashboard is developed to analyze workforce diversity, gender distribution, performance ratings, promotions, turnover, and hiring patterns within an organization.

The goal of this project is to practice and apply the **Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act** framework to uncover insights that support data-driven HR and organizational decisions.

---

## Background of Study

The dataset contains employee information such as gender, job level, department, performance rating, age group, promotion history, hires, and turnover data.
This project evaluates diversity metrics across the entire employee lifecycle—from hiring to promotion to retention.

## 1. Ask

### Business Task

Identify workforce diversity patterns and assess whether gender and age groups are represented fairly across performance ratings, promotions, leadership positions, and turnover.

### Key Questions

* What is the gender balance across all job levels and executive roles?
* Are promotions distributed fairly between men and women?
* How does performance rating vary by gender or age group?
* Do turnover rates suggest potential equality gaps?
* What hiring patterns exist across job levels and genders?

### Key Stakeholders

* **HR & People Analytics Team** – Focus on workforce insights and diversity metrics.
* **Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO)** – Uses insights to improve hiring, promotion, and retention strategies.
* **Leadership & Executive Team** – Ensures compliance, fairness, and opportunities across the organization.

## 3. Process

### **Data Preparation & Cleaning**

* Validated **job levels**, **gender categories**, and **age groups**.
* Resolved missing values in **performance ratings** and **job grade**.
* Standardized **hire date**, **promotion date**, and **turnover indicators**.
* Created calculated fields for:

  * % of women in leadership
  * Promotion rates by gender
  * Turnover rate by gender
  * Average performance rating
  * Time-in-grade for promoted employees

## 4. Analyze

This section summarizes key findings from both **Page 1** (Workforce Overview) and **Page 2** (Hiring, Promotion, and Turnover).

---


###  **Page 1: Hiring, Promotion & Turnover**

#### **Hiring by Gender**

* **41% of hires were women**, **59% were men**.
* Women were hired more frequently in junior roles than leadership roles.

  * Example:

    * Junior Officer: **53% female hires**
    * Executive: **13% female hires**

#### **Promotions by Gender**

* Women represented:

  * **15.8% of promoted Executives**
  * **19.3% of promoted Senior Managers**
  * **31.6% of promoted Managers**
  * **52.1% of promoted Senior Officers**

Women receive more promotions in lower job levels but significantly fewer in senior roles.

#### **Turnover Rate (FY20 Leavers)**

* **Female turnover:** 11%
* **Male turnover:** 9%

Performance rating comparison between leavers and non-leavers shows:

* Leavers (both genders) tend to have **lower performance scores** than employees who stayed.
* Turnover is higher among mid-level job grades.

#### **Time in Grade Before Promotion**

* Promotion time varies by job level:

  * Executive: **1.86–3.00 years**
  * Junior Officer: **2.13–2.20 years**
  * Senior Manager / Manager: **1.8–2.7 years**

---

### **Page 2: Workforce Diversity Overview**

#### **Performance Rating by Gender**

* Performance scores between men and women remain **very similar** across all rating levels.
* Average performance:

  * **Women:** 2.42
  * **Men:** 2.41

#### **Executive Gender Balance**

* FY20: **12.5% women**, **87.5% men**
* FY21: **15.8% women**, **84.2% men**
* Executive hires and executive promotions: **100% male**

This shows limited female representation in leadership positions.

#### **Age Group Distribution**

* Largest employee segments:

  * **20–29 years** (215 employees)
  * **30–39 years** (161 employees)
* Junior and Senior Officers are heavily dominated by younger age groups.
* Executives are primarily aged **40+**, indicating an expected seniority trend.

## 7. Conclusion

This Diversity & Inclusion analysis highlights how gender representation shifts across the organization—from junior positions to executive leadership.
While gender balance is relatively even at entry-level roles, representation gaps widen significantly at higher job levels.

Hiring, promotion, and turnover trends reveal opportunities to improve:

* Leadership diversity
* Promotion fairness
* Retention of women in senior roles

The dashboard provides clear insights HR teams can use to drive equitable and inclusive workforce planning.
